            This paper considers the diapycnal transport of passive tracers during a Kelvin–Helmholtz mixing event. Numerical simulations of a traditional Kelvin–Helmholtz ({KH}) configuration of a stratified shear flow are extended to include layers of passive tracer at different locations relative to the shear layer. The evolution of the tracers during the simulation is followed and is analysed using different theoretical approaches. One is to consider the evolution via the distribution in density–tracer space which clearly reveals how the tracers are redistributed across isopycnals by the mixing driven by the growing and saturating {KH} billow. The shape of the distribution places constraints on the redistribution of the tracer and, for this problem of symmetrically stratified shear, it is shown that the distribution typically tends to a compact form, with significant regions that are nearly linear. The redistribution across isopycnals is also considered via a diffusion equation for the tracer relative to coordinates based on the geometry of density surfaces. The equation is a generalisation of an equation previously derived for transport of density in these coordinates and includes an extra eddy term that arises because there is variation of the tracer along density surfaces. Under certain circumstances and at later stages of the flow, the eddy term can be neglected, and the evolution of the mean tracer profile can be adequately represented using a simple diffusion equation where diffusivity is defined as the effective diffusivity of density, scaled by the molecular diffusion of the tracer.},

Distinct curves form in the polar vortex, the midlatitude “surf zones”, and the tropics. Theory predicts such relationships for sufficiently rapid mixing along isentropic surfaces. Model results are used to illustrate the formation and seasonal evolution of distinct tracer relationships in the different regions. Using such relationships to associate departures from canonical forms with anomalous chemical or microphysical behavior must be done with care and with full awareness of the meteorological context of the data. Although the theory has been developed in the context of stratospheric tracers, the key requirement is that transport is predominantly two-dimensional. While the theory is thus inappropriate in the troposphere, it should be applicable to transport in the ocean interior.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric tracers are often observed to be functionally related, and these relations can be physically or chemically significant. It is therefore highly desirable that the transport schemes used in chemistry and chemistry-climate models should not disrupt such functional relations in unphysical ways through numerical mixing or, indeed, unmixing. Here, diagnostics are proposed that quantify numerical mixing by a transport scheme for a single tracer, two tracers that are nonlinearly related, and three (or more) tracers that add up to a constant. For the two-tracer test, the question of how physically reasonable the numerical mixing is can be addressed by using scatter/correlation plots. Truncation errors will, in general, result in scatter points deviating from the preexisting functional curve and thereby introduce numerical mixing between the tracers. The proposed diagnostics quantify the mixing in terms of the normalized distances between the pre-existing functional curve and scatter points, and divide it into three categories: real mixing and two types of spurious numerical unmixing. For the three-tracer test, we quantify, in terms of standard error norms, how nearly a transport scheme can preserve the sum by transporting the individual tracers. The mixing diagnostics do not require the knowledge of the analytical solution to the transport problem for the individual tracers. However, using an idealized flow field and spatial distributions facilitates the use of the mixing diagnostics in transport scheme development. Hence we propose to exercise the new mixing diagnostics using an idealized but highly deformational analytical flow field. Example results using the {CSLAM} (Conservative Semi-{LAgrangian} Multi-tracer) scheme are presented. Copyright © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

This flux θd is purely diffusive and is, in principle, exactly known at all times given the scalar field and the coefficient of molecular diffusivity. In general, the complex geometry of isoscalar surfaces would appear to make the calculation of this flux very difficult. In this paper, we derive an exact expression relating the instantaneous diascalar flux to the average squared scalar gradient on an isoscalar surface which does not require knowledge of the spatial structure of the surface itself. To obtain this result, a time-dependent reference state θ(t,z*.) is defined. When the scalar is taken to be density, this reference state is that of minimum potential energy. The rate of change of the reference state due to diffusion is shown to equal the divergence of the diffusive flux, i.e. (∂/∂z*)θd.This result provides a mathematical framework that exactly separates diffusive and advective scalar transport in incompressible fluid flows. The relationship between diffusive and advective transport is discussed in relation to the scalar variance equation and the Osborn–Cox model. Estimation of water mass transformation from oceanic microstructure profiles and determination of the time-dependent mixing rate in numerically simulated flows are discussed.},

While diffusion is necessary to invoke transport, the large-scale kinematics regulate the evolution of q through the stretching and redistribution of Le2. It is argued that Le2 is a useful, easy to compute diagnostic for irreversible transport, especially for identifying a barrier. Typical behaviors of Le2 in various flow regimes are illustrated using the numerically simulated Kelvin-Helmholtz billow. Signature of mixing is found in the irreversible growth of Le2, but the precise time dependence is complex due to interplay between advection and diffusion. Formation of the edges (concentrated gradients) and their permeability to mass are addressed using a kinematic model with prescribed Le2. Relevance of this model to the stratospheric polar vortex, midlatitude tropopause, and oceanic thermocline is discussed.},

It is shown that the method is particularly useful for investigations of mesoscale mixing as observed in frontal zones where interleaving and intrusions are commonly observed, and that it can be used for obtaining bulk estimates of the impact of non-isopycnal, small-scale mixing events on the mesoscale fields. Possible parameters are discussed and sources of errors reviewed. Examples are used to show that major nutrients can be used as parameters to detect non-isopycnal mixing although limitations in the historical data and low data accuracy lead to considerable error bounds at present.

	abstract = {Mixing plots, in which a dissolved constituent is plotted against salinity or chlorinity, are commonly used to interpret conservative and non-conservative processes in estuarine systems. A bend in the resulting curve is generally interpreted as indicative of the reactive or non-conservative nature of the constituent or the presence of multiple sources or sinks within the estuary. This paper demonstrates analytically that bends in mixing curves may also result from temporal variations in end-member (river or ocean) constituent concentrations even for conservative constituents. A one-dimensional dispersion equation is used to calculate the distribution of salinity and a conservative constituent in a model estuary. Both straight and bent mixing curves are shown resulting simply from changing the variability of the river constituent concentration. For no variability the curve is straight. For variability with a period much less than the flushing time, the average curve for a general data set is straight, whereas the curve for a synoptic data set is bent. For variability with a period greater than the flushing time a bent curve results. Since bent mixing curves can occur for conservative properties, the use of these curves for interpretation of estuarine processes must be undertaken with an understanding of the temporal variability of the river and ocean constituents and their relationship to the estuary mixing properties and flushing time.},

We observe that the processes by which the flow undergoes breakdown are both complex and diverse, and suggest that the ratio, D, of the depth of the shear layer to the total tank depth and/or the (nondimensional) total density difference are important parameters in the determination of the dominant structures. In general, inherently three-dimensional, and relatively large-scale, flow structures strongly suppress simple subharmonic vortex pairing, and appear to dominate totally the transition to turbulence. In certain circumstances, the primary instabilities of the flow, namely Kelvin-Helmholtz billows, are able to develop in a quasi-two-dimensional manner before interaction between neighbouring billows becomes significant. In these circumstances, narrow secondary streamwise ‘tubes’ of vorticity are observed between neighbouring billows. Alternatively subharmonic, quasi-two-dimensional vortex mergings may be observed; these are not just simple pairings, but also three vortices are observed to merge into a single secondary billow, or two merge and the other persists, as predicted theoretically by Klaassen and Peltier (J. Fluid Mech., 202: 367–402, 1989). Three-dimensional vortex merging (knotting) of initially quasi-two-dimensional billows is also observed. Such knots are observed not only as pairwise transitions, as discussed by Thorpe (Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid Dyn., 34: 175–199, 1985), but also single billows are observed to knot with both adjacent neighbours simultaneously. Also, billows are observed to bow during merging events. However, particularly at larger density differences, higher Reynolds number and when the depth ratio, D, is sufficiently small, billow-billow interactions are apparent essentially immediately upon instability onset. Although the structures which develop resemble secondary tubes, these structures appear to be a primary instability of the flow, analogous to an instability observed by other researchers in both forced and unforced homogeneous shear layers.},

The stability problem is thereby reduced to standard eigenvalue form, and solutions that do not satisfy the timescale constraint are rejected. If the Reynolds number of the initial parallel flow is sufficiently high the two-dimensional wave is found to be unstable and the fastest-growing modes are three-dimensional disturbances that possess longitudinal symmetry. These modes are convective in nature and focused in the statically unstable regions that form during the overturning of the stratified fluid in the core of the nonlinear vortex. The nature of the instability in the high-Reynolds-number regime suggests that it is intimately related to the observed onset of turbulence in these waves.

Vortex pairing is found to be the most rapidly amplified mode in a continuous spectrum of vortex merging instabilities. In certain not uncommon circumstances it is possible for more than two vortices to amalgamate in a single interaction, demonstrating that the phenomenon that has become known as the pairing resonance in fact has a rather low quality factor. Another form of merging instability in which a vortex is deformed and drained by its neighbours has been revealed by our linear stability analyses of nonlinear shear-layer disturbances. It appears, however, that this vortex draining instability may be important only in unstratified or very weakly stratified flows, since in moderately stratified Kelvin–Helmholtz flow, it is replaced by a highly localized instability which leads to a temporary distortion of the braids. Nonlinear simulations of vortex merging events in moderately stratified, high-Reynolds-number shear layers are compared to the theoretical predictions of our stability analyses. We investigate and quantify the sensitivity of merging events to variations in the initial conditions. The character of the flow after merging instability saturates and the nonlinear aspects of multiple merging events are also considered.},
