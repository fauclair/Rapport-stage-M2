	abstract = {Mixing plots, in which a dissolved constituent is plotted against salinity or chlorinity, are commonly used to interpret conservative and non-conservative processes in estuarine systems. A bend in the resulting curve is generally interpreted as indicative of the reactive or non-conservative nature of the constituent or the presence of multiple sources or sinks within the estuary. This paper demonstrates analytically that bends in mixing curves may also result from temporal variations in end-member (river or ocean) constituent concentrations even for conservative constituents. A onedimensional dispersion equation is used to calculate the distribution of salinity and a conservative constituent in a model estuary. Both straight and bent mixing curves are shown resulting simply from changing the variability of the river constituent concentration. For no variability the curve is straight. For variability with a period much less than the flushing time, the average curve for a general data set is straight, whereas the curve for a synoptic data set is bent. For variability with a period greater than the flushing time a bent curve results. Since bent mixing curves can occur for conservative properties, the use of these curves for interpretation of estuarine processes must be undertaken with an understanding of the temporal variability of the river and ocean constituents and their relationship to the estuary mixing properties and flushing time.},

In particular, we investigate whether a secondary braid instability might emerge prior to the overturning of the statically unstable regions that develop in the cores of the primary Kelvin–Helmholtz billows. We identify two groups of instabilities on the braid. One group is a shear instability which extracts its energy from the background shear and is suppressed by the straining contribution of the background ﬂow. The other group, which seems to have no precedent in the literature, includes phase-locked modes which grow at the stagnation point on the braid and are almost entirely driven by the straining contributions of the background ﬂow. For the latter group, the braid shear has a negative inﬂuence on the growth rate. Our analysis demonstrates that the probability of ﬁnite-amplitude growth of both braid instabilities is enhanced with increasing Reynolds number and Richardson number. We also show that the possibility of emergence of braid instabilities decreases with the Prandtl number for the shear modes and increases for the stagnation point instabilities. Through detailed non-separable linear stability analysis, we show that both braid instabilities are fundamentally three dimensional with the shear modes being of small wavenumbers and the stagnation point modes dominating at large wavenumber.},

We show that over a wide range of background stratiﬁcation levels, the braid shear instability has a higher probability of emerging at early stages of the ﬂow evolution while the secondary convective instability (SCI), which occurs in the eyelids of the individual Kelvin ‘cats eyes’, will remain a relevant and dominant instability at high Reynolds numbers. The evolution of both modes is greatly inﬂuenced by the background stratiﬁcation. Various other three-dimensional secondary instabilities are found to exist over a wide range of stratiﬁcation levels. In particular, the stagnation point instability (SPI), which was discussed in detail in MP1, may be of great potential importance providing alternate routes for transition of an initially two-dimensional KH wave into fully developed turbulence. The energetics of the secondary instabilities revealed by our simulations are analysed in detail and the preturbulent mixing properties are studied.},

              Motivated by the importance of diapycnal mixing parameterizations in large-scale ocean general circulation models, we provide a detailed analysis of high-Reynolds-number mixing in density stratified shear flows which constitute an archetypical example of the small-scale physical processes occurring in the oceanic interior that control turbulent diffusion. Our focus is upon the issue as to whether the route to fully developed turbulence in the stratified mixing layer is in any significant way determinant of diapycnal mixing efficiency as represented by an effective turbulent diffusivity. We characterize different routes to fully developed turbulence by the nature of the secondary instabilities through which a primary Kelvin–Helmholtz billow executes the transition to this state. We then demonstrate that different mechanisms of turbulence transition characterized in these different transition mechanisms lead to considerably different values for the efficiency of diapycnal mixing and also for the effective vertical flux of buoyancy. We show that the widely employed value of 0.15–0.2 for the efficiency of mixing in shear-induced stratified turbulence based upon both laboratory measurements and similarly low-Reynolds-number numerical simulations may be too low for the high-Reynolds-number regime characteristic of geophysical flows. Our results show that the mixing efficiency tends to a value of approximately

              for sufficiently large Reynolds number at an intermediate value of 0.12 for the Richardson number. This is in agreement with a theoretical predictions of Caulfield, Tang and Plasting (
              J. Fluid Mech.
              , vol. 498, 2004, pp. 315–332) for the asymptotic value of mixing efficiency in stratified Couette flows. In the high-Reynolds-number regime, mixing efficiency is shown to vary over a considerable range during the course of a particular shear-induced mixing event. We explain this variation on the basis of a detailed examination of the underlying dynamics. Since values in the range 0.15–0.2 for mixing efficiency have been extensively employed to infer an effective diffusivity from ocean microstructure measurements and also in energy balance analyses of the requirements of the global ocean circulation, our findings have potentially important implications for large-scale ocean modelling. We also quantify the errors introduced by employing the Osborn (
              J. Phys. Oceanogr.
              , vol. 10, 1980, pp. 83–89) formula along with an efficiency of 0.15 to infer values for effective diffusivity, and explain the logical underpinnings of this conclusion. One of the more important aspects of this work from the perspective of our theoretical understanding of stratified turbulence is the demonstration that the inverse cascade of energy, which is facilitated by the vortex-merging process that is typical of laboratory experiments and of the low-Reynolds-number simulations of shear flow evolution, is strongly suppressed by increase of the Reynolds number to values typical of geophysical flows. Based on this finding, the application of results based on low-Reynolds-number (numerical or laboratory) experiments to high-Reynolds-number geophysical shear flows needs to be reconsidered.},

This flux θd is purely diffusive and is, in principle, exactly known at all times given the scalar field and the coefficient of molecular diffusivity. In general, the complex geometry of isoscalar surfaces would appear to make the calculation of this flux very difficult. In this paper, we derive an exact expression relating the instantaneous diascalar flux to the average squared scalar gradient on an isoscalar surface which does not require knowledge of the spatial structure of the surface itself. To obtain this result, a time-dependent reference state θ(t,z*.) is defined. When the scalar is taken to be density, this reference state is that of minimum potential energy. The rate of change of the reference state due to diffusion is shown to equal the divergence of the diffusive flux, i.e. (∂/∂z*)θd.This result provides a mathematical framework that exactly separates diffusive and advective scalar transport in incompressible fluid flows. The relationship between diffusive and advective transport is discussed in relation to the scalar variance equation and the Osborn–Cox model. Estimation of water mass transformation from oceanic microstructure profiles and determination of the time-dependent mixing rate in numerically simulated flows are discussed.},

While diffusion is necessary to invoke transport, the large-scale kinematics regulate the evolution of q through the stretching and redistribution of Le2. It is argued that Le2 is a useful, easy to compute diagnostic for irreversible transport, especially for identifying a barrier. Typical behaviors of Le2 in various flow regimes are illustrated using the numerically simulated Kelvin-Helmholtz billow. Signature of mixing is found in the irreversible growth of Le2, but the precise time dependence is complex due to interplay between advection and diffusion. Formation of the edges (concentrated gradients) and their permeability to mass are addressed using a kinematic model with prescribed Le2. Relevance of this model to the stratospheric polar vortex, midlatitude tropopause, and oceanic thermocline is discussed.},

	abstract = {Linear stability analyses and nonlinear flow simulations reveal several important features of transverse secondary instabilities of two-dimensional Kelvin–Helmholtz billows and Stuart vortices. Vortex pairing is found to be the most rapidly amplified mode in a continuous spectrum of vortex merging instabilities. In certain not uncommon circumstances it is possible for more than two vortices to amalgamate in a single interaction, demonstrating that the phenomenon that has become known as the pairing resonance in fact has a rather low quality factor. Another form of merging instability in which a vortex is deformed and drained by its neighbours has been revealed by our linear stability analyses of nonlinear shear-layer disturbances. It appears, however, that this vortex draining instability may be important only in unstratified or very weakly stratified flows, since in moderately stratified Kelvin–Helmholtz flow, it is replaced by a highly localized instability which leads to a temporary distortion of the braids. Nonlinear simulations of vortex merging events in moderately stratified, high-Reynolds-number shear layers are compared to the theoretical predictions of our stability analyses. We investigate and quantify the sensitivity of merging events to variations in the initial conditions. The character of the flow after merging instability saturates and the nonlinear aspects of multiple merging events are also considered.},

	abstract = {We study the competition between various secondary instabilities that co-exist in a preturbulent stratiﬁed parallel ﬂow subject to Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. In particular, we investigate whether a secondary braid instability might emerge prior to the overturning of the statically unstable regions that develop in the cores of the primary Kelvin–Helmholtz billows. We identify two groups of instabilities on the braid. One group is a shear instability which extracts its energy from the background shear and is suppressed by the straining contribution of the background ﬂow. The other group, which seems to have no precedent in the literature, includes phase-locked modes which grow at the stagnation point on the braid and are almost entirely driven by the straining contributions of the background ﬂow. For the latter group, the braid shear has a negative inﬂuence on the growth rate. Our analysis demonstrates that the probability of ﬁnite-amplitude growth of both braid instabilities is enhanced with increasing Reynolds number and Richardson number. We also show that the possibility of emergence of braid instabilities decreases with the Prandtl number for the shear modes and increases for the stagnation point instabilities. Through detailed non-separable linear stability analysis, we show that both braid instabilities are fundamentally three dimensional with the shear modes being of small wavenumbers and the stagnation point modes dominating at large wavenumber.},

We show that over a wide range of background stratiﬁcation levels, the braid shear instability has a higher probability of emerging at early stages of the ﬂow evolution while the secondary convective instability (SCI), which occurs in the eyelids of the individual Kelvin ‘cats eyes’, will remain a relevant and dominant instability at high Reynolds numbers. The evolution of both modes is greatly inﬂuenced by the background stratiﬁcation. Various other three-dimensional secondary instabilities are found to exist over a wide range of stratiﬁcation levels. In particular, the stagnation point instability (SPI), which was discussed in detail in MP1, may be of great potential importance providing alternate routes for transition of an initially two-dimensional KH wave into fully developed turbulence. The energetics of the secondary instabilities revealed by our simulations are analysed in detail and the preturbulent mixing properties are studied.},

The ratio of diffusivities is obtained as a function of buoyancy Reynolds number Reb and of the density ratio R␳ (the ratio of the contributions of heat and salt to the density stratification). The diffusivity ratio is generally less than unity (heat is mixed more effectively than salt), but it approaches unity with increasing Reb and also with increasing R␳. Instantaneous diffusivity ratios near unity are achieved during the most turbulent phase of the event even when Reb is small; much of the Reb dependence results from the fact that, at higher Reb, the diffusivity ratio remains close to unity for a longer time after the turbulence decays. An explanation for this is proposed in terms of the Batchelor scaling for scalar fields. Results are interpreted in terms of the dynamics of turbulent Kelvin–Helmholtz billows, and are compared in detail with previous studies of differential diffusion in numerical, laboratory, and observational contexts. The overall picture suggests that the diffusivities become approximately equal when Reb exceeds O(102). The effect of R␳ is significant only when Reb is less than this value.},

We observe that the processes by which the flow undergoes breakdown are both complex and diverse, and suggest that the ratio, D, of the depth of the shear layer to the total tank depth and/or the (nondimensional) total density difference are important parameters in the determination of the dominant structures. In general, inherently three-dimensional, and relatively large-scale, flow structures strongly suppress simple subharmonic vortex pairing, and appear to dominate totally the transition to turbulence. In certain circumstances, the primary instabilities of the flow, namely Kelvin-Helmholtz billows, are able to develop in a quasi-two-dimensional manner before interaction between neighbouring billows becomes significant. In these circumstances, narrow secondary streamwise 'tubes' of vorticity are observed between neighbouring billows. Alternatively subharmonic, quasi-two-dimensional vortex mergings may be observed; these are not just simple pairings, but also three vortices are observed to merge into a single secondary billow, or two merge and the other persists, as predicted theoretically by Klaassen and Peltier (J. Fluid Mech., 202: 367-402, 1989). Three-dimensional vortex merging (knotting) of initially quasi-two-dimensional billows is also observed. Such knots are observed not only as pairwise transitions, as discussed by Thorpe (Geophys.},

Similarly enigmatic has been an explanation of the numerical value of ∼0.2, which is observed to characterize this efficiency experimentally. We review recent work on the turbulence transition in stratified parallel flows that demonstrates that this value is not only numerically predictable but also that it is expected to be a nonmonotonic function of the Richardson number that characterizes preturbulent stratification strength. This value of the mixing efficiency appears to be characteristic of the late-time behavior of the turbulent flow that develops after an initially laminar shear flow has undergone the transition to turbulence through an intermediate instability of Kelvin-Helmholtz type.},

            This paper considers the diapycnal transport of passive tracers during a Kelvin–Helmholtz mixing event. Numerical simulations of a traditional Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) configuration of a stratified shear flow are extended to include layers of passive tracer at different locations relative to the shear layer. The evolution of the tracers during the simulation is followed and is analysed using different theoretical approaches. One is to consider the evolution via the distribution in density–tracer space which clearly reveals how the tracers are redistributed across isopycnals by the mixing driven by the growing and saturating KH billow. The shape of the distribution places constraints on the redistribution of the tracer and, for this problem of symmetrically stratified shear, it is shown that the distribution typically tends to a compact form, with significant regions that are nearly linear. The redistribution across isopycnals is also considered via a diffusion equation for the tracer relative to coordinates based on the geometry of density surfaces. The equation is a generalisation of an equation previously derived for transport of density in these coordinates and includes an extra eddy term that arises because there is variation of the tracer along density surfaces. Under certain circumstances and at later stages of the flow, the eddy term can be neglected, and the evolution of the mean tracer profile can be adequately represented using a simple diffusion equation where diffusivity is defined as the effective diffusivity of density, scaled by the molecular diffusion of the tracer.},

The conceptual framework of the subject, strongly inﬂuenced by the Kolmogorov cascade phenomenology, is undergoing a drastic reinterpretation as empirical evidence shows that local isotropy, both at the inertial and dissipation scales, is violated. New results of the complex morphology of the scalar ﬁeld are reviewed, and they are related to the intermittency problem.

	abstract = {▪ Abstract The coexistence in the deep ocean of a finite, stable stratification, a strong meridional overturning circulation, and mesoscale eddies raises complex questions concerning the circulation energetics. In particular, small-scale mixing processes are necessary to resupply the potential energy removed in the interior by the overturning and eddy-generating process. A number of lines of evidence, none complete, suggest that the oceanic general circulation, far from being a heat engine, is almost wholly governed by the forcing of the wind field and secondarily by deep water tides. In detail however, the budget of mechanical energy input into the ocean is poorly constrained. The now inescapable conclusion that over most of the ocean significant “vertical” mixing is confined to topographically complex boundary areas implies a potentially radically different interior circulation than is possible with uniform mixing. Whether ocean circulation models, either simple box or full numerical ones, neither explicitly accounting for the energy input into the system nor providing for spatial variability in the mixing, have any physical relevance under changed climate conditions is at issue.},

We observe that the processes by which the flow undergoes breakdown are both complex and diverse, and suggest that the ratio, D, of the depth of the shear layer to the total tank depth and/or the (nondimensional) total density difference are important parameters in the determination of the dominant structures. In general, inherently three-dimensional, and relatively large-scale, flow structures strongly suppress simple subharmonic vortex pairing, and appear to dominate totally the transition to turbulence. In certain circumstances, the primary instabilities of the flow, namely Kelvin-Helmholtz billows, are able to develop in a quasi-two-dimensional manner before interaction between neighbouring billows becomes significant. In these circumstances, narrow secondary streamwise 'tubes' of vorticity are observed between neighbouring billows. Alternatively subharmonic, quasi-two-dimensional vortex mergings may be observed; these are not just simple pairings, but also three vortices are observed to merge into a single secondary billow, or two merge and the other persists, as predicted theoretically by Klaassen and Peltier (J. Fluid Mech., 202: 367-402, 1989). Three-dimensional vortex merging (knotting) of initially quasi-two-dimensional billows is also observed. Such knots are observed not only as pairwise transitions, as discussed by Thorpe (Geophys.},

Distinct curves form in the polar vortex, the midlatitude “surf zones”, and the tropics. Theory predicts such relationships for sufficiently rapid mixing along isentropic surfaces. Model results are used to illustrate the formation and seasonal evolution of distinct tracer relationships in the different regions. Using such relationships to associate departures from canonical forms with anomalous chemical or microphysical behavior must be done with care and with full awareness of the meteorological context of the data. Although the theory has been developed in the context of stratospheric tracers, the key requirement is that transport is predominantly two-dimensional. While the theory is thus inappropriate in the troposphere, it should be applicable to transport in the ocean interior.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric tracers are often observed to be functionally related, and these relations can be physically or chemically significant. It is therefore highly desirable that the transport schemes used in chemistry and chemistry-climate models should not disrupt such functional relations in unphysical ways through numerical mixing or, indeed, unmixing. Here, diagnostics are proposed that quantify numerical mixing by a transport scheme for a single tracer, two tracers that are nonlinearly related, and three (or more) tracers that add up to a constant. For the two-tracer test, the question of how physically reasonable the numerical mixing is can be addressed by using scatter/correlation plots. Truncation errors will, in general, result in scatter points deviating from the preexisting functional curve and thereby introduce numerical mixing between the tracers. The proposed diagnostics quantify the mixing in terms of the normalized distances between the pre-existing functional curve and scatter points, and divide it into three categories: real mixing and two types of spurious numerical unmixing. For the three-tracer test, we quantify, in terms of standard error norms, how nearly a transport scheme can preserve the sum by transporting the individual tracers. The mixing diagnostics do not require the knowledge of the analytical solution to the transport problem for the individual tracers. However, using an idealized flow field and spatial distributions facilitates the use of the mixing diagnostics in transport scheme development. Hence we propose to exercise the new mixing diagnostics using an idealized but highly deformational analytical flow field.

This flux θd is purely diffusive and is, in principle, exactly known at all times given the scalar field and the coefficient of molecular diffusivity. In general, the complex geometry of isoscalar surfaces would appear to make the calculation of this flux very difficult. In this paper, we derive an exact expression relating the instantaneous diascalar flux to the average squared scalar gradient on an isoscalar surface which does not require knowledge of the spatial structure of the surface itself. To obtain this result, a time-dependent reference state θ(t,z*.) is defined. When the scalar is taken to be density, this reference state is that of minimum potential energy. The rate of change of the reference state due to diffusion is shown to equal the divergence of the diffusive flux, i.e. (∂/∂z*)θd.This result provides a mathematical framework that exactly separates diffusive and advective scalar transport in incompressible fluid flows. The relationship between diffusive and advective transport is discussed in relation to the scalar variance equation and the Osborn–Cox model. Estimation of water mass transformation from oceanic microstructure profiles and determination of the time-dependent mixing rate in numerically simulated flows are discussed.},

While diffusion is necessary to invoke transport, the large-scale kinematics regulate the evolution of q through the stretching and redistribution of Le2. It is argued that Le2 is a useful, easy to compute diagnostic for irreversible transport, especially for identifying a barrier. Typical behaviors of Le2 in various flow regimes are illustrated using the numerically simulated Kelvin-Helmholtz billow. Signature of mixing is found in the irreversible growth of Le2, but the precise time dependence is complex due to interplay between advection and diffusion. Formation of the edges (concentrated gradients) and their permeability to mass are addressed using a kinematic model with prescribed Le2. Relevance of this model to the stratospheric polar vortex, midlatitude tropopause, and oceanic thermocline is discussed.},

It is shown that the method is particularly useful for investigations of mesoscale mixing as observed in frontal zones where interleaving and intrusions are commonly observed, and that it can be used for obtaining bulk estimates of the impact of non-isopycnal, small-scale mixing events on the mesoscale fields. Possible parameters are discussed and sources of errors reviewed. Examples are used to show that major nutrients can be used as parameters to detect non-isopycnal mixing although limitations in the historical data and low data accuracy lead to considerable error bounds at present.

A bend in the resulting curve is generally interpreted as indicative of the reactive or non-conservative nature of the constituent or the presence of multiple sources or sinks within the estuary. This paper demonstrates analytically that bends in mixing curves may also result from temporal variations in end-member (river or ocean) constituent concentrations even for conservative constituents. A one-dimensional dispersion equation is used to calculate the distribution of salinity and a conservative constituent in a model estuary. Both straight and bent mixing curves are shown resulting simply from changing the variability of the river constituent concentration. For no variability the curve is straight. For variability with a period much less than the flushing time, the average curve for a general data set is straight, whereas the curve for a synoptic data set is bent. For variability with a period greater than the flushing time a bent curve results. Since bent mixing curves can occur for conservative properties, the use of these curves for interpretation of estuarine processes must be undertaken with an understanding of the temporal variability of the river and ocean constituents and their relationship to the estuary mixing properties and flushing time.},

This general formulation is used to discuss the concept of concentrate-salinity mixing curves.

The full set of compressible Navier-Stokes equations is integrated for a free-surface ocean with three time-steps respectively associated to the internal, external and compressible (non Boussinesq) modes. The resulting three-mode algorithm can be implemented either in a fully compressible configuration or in a "pseudo-compressible" configuration by artificially lowering acoustic-wave velocities to reduce computational costs. The present description of the three-mode algorithm focuses in the first place on the simulation of non-hydrostatic processes in free-surface ocean models. Several test simulations related to linear and non-linear acoustic, surface and internal gravity waves are studied in details with the proposed three-mode algorithm.},

	abstract = {We investigate the processes by which an accelerating stratified shear flow undergoes the transition to turbulence in a sequence of experiments in a tilted tank. We observe that the processes by which the flow undergoes breakdown are both complex and diverse, and suggest that the ratio, D, of the depth of the shear layer to the total tank depth and/or the (nondimensional) total density difference are important parameters in the determination of the dominant structures. In general, inherently three-dimensional, and relatively large-scale, flow structures strongly suppress simple subharmonic vortex pairing, and appear to dominate totally the transition to turbulence. In certain circumstances, the primary instabilities of the flow, namely Kelvin-Helmholtz billows, are able to develop in a quasi-two-dimensional manner before interaction between neighbouring billows becomes significant. In these circumstances, narrow secondary streamwise ‘tubes’ of vorticity are observed between neighbouring billows. Alternatively subharmonic, quasi-two-dimensional vortex mergings may be observed; these are not just simple pairings, but also three vortices are observed to merge into a single secondary billow, or two merge and the other persists, as predicted theoretically by Klaassen and Peltier (J. Fluid Mech., 202: 367–402, 1989). Three-dimensional vortex merging (knotting) of initially quasi-two-dimensional billows is also observed. Such knots are observed not only as pairwise transitions, as discussed by Thorpe (Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid Dyn., 34: 175–199, 1985), but also single billows are observed to knot with both adjacent neighbours simultaneously. Also, billows are observed to bow during merging events. However, particularly at larger density differences, higher Reynolds number and when the depth ratio, D, is sufficiently small, billow-billow interactions are apparent essentially immediately upon instability onset. Although the structures which develop resemble secondary tubes, these structures appear to be a primary instability of the flow, analogous to an instability observed by other researchers in both forced and unforced homogeneous shear layers.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional finite-amplitude Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are tested for stability against three-dimensional infinitesimal perturbations. Since the nonlinear waves are time-dependent, the stability analysis is based upon the assumption that they evolve on a timescale which is long compared with that of any instability which they might support. The stability problem is thereby reduced to standard eigenvalue form, and solutions that do not satisfy the timescale constraint are rejected. If the Reynolds number of the initial parallel flow is sufficiently high the two-dimensional wave is found to be unstable and the fastest-growing modes are three-dimensional disturbances that possess longitudinal symmetry. These modes are convective in nature and focused in the statically unstable regions that form during the overturning of the stratified fluid in the core of the nonlinear vortex. The nature of the instability in the high-Reynolds-number regime suggests that it is intimately related to the observed onset of turbulence in these waves. The transition Reynolds number above which the secondary instability exists depends strongly on the initial conditions from which the primary wave evolves.},

	abstract = {Linear stability analyses and nonlinear flow simulations reveal several important features of transverse secondary instabilities of two-dimensional Kelvin–Helmholtz billows and Stuart vortices. Vortex pairing is found to be the most rapidly amplified mode in a continuous spectrum of vortex merging instabilities. In certain not uncommon circumstances it is possible for more than two vortices to amalgamate in a single interaction, demonstrating that the phenomenon that has become known as the pairing resonance in fact has a rather low quality factor. Another form of merging instability in which a vortex is deformed and drained by its neighbours has been revealed by our linear stability analyses of nonlinear shear-layer disturbances. It appears, however, that this vortex draining instability may be important only in unstratified or very weakly stratified flows, since in moderately stratified Kelvin–Helmholtz flow, it is replaced by a highly localized instability which leads to a temporary distortion of the braids. Nonlinear simulations of vortex merging events in moderately stratified, high-Reynolds-number shear layers are compared to the theoretical predictions of our stability analyses. We investigate and quantify the sensitivity of merging events to variations in the initial conditions. The character of the flow after merging instability saturates and the nonlinear aspects of multiple merging events are also considered.},
